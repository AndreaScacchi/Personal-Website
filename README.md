*That's my personal website. My home. It's a reflection of who I am.*  

I created it because I can share my studies, projects, experiences, and also because people can easily connect with me.  
So, reach me if you are interest in ***Computer Science*** and want to talk about it, or you want to collaborate with me, I'll be enthusiastic :grinning::computer:  

It's a work in progress, but I'm proud of what I have accomplished so far. For this reason, I'm constantly adding new features, and if you have any suggestions on how I can improve it, or if you noticed any problems, please let me know! I'm always looking for any feedback!:v:  


## **Overview about me**  

### *Who I am*  
<**Hello World!**:earth_americas:>  
I'm Andrea, a Computer Science student a the ***University of Rome Tor Vergata***. I really like spending my time coding new ideas, making new projects, learning new technologies and reading books. However, in addition to improving my skills related to the coding, I'm interested in learning math, physics, logic, algorithms, theory of computation, robotics, AI, machine learning, data analysis, data science and more.  
I also have different hobbies, such as playing videogames, reading Mickey Mouse comics, learning new languages and going for a run outside in the early mornings.  


### *My tech stack*:man_technologist:  
- HTML
- Css
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Python
- C  


### *Why did I choose the Bachelor's degree in CS*ðŸŽ“  
Honestly, there are many reasons concerning this choice. However, the most significant are:
- I can learn from the others
- I can study many different things at high level and with high quality
- I can learn how to think
- I can learn how to approch different problems

These are really good reasons, but there is one more: **MAKE NEW FRIENDS**. It's the most important one. This is an amazing experience only if you share it with your friends, and university is the perfect place to know new people and create relationships.  


### *The end*  
So, that's my intro, my journey so far. I'll make new changes in the future, but for now that's all.  
Visit my website, give me a feedback and if you want, share with me your journey, I'll be really happy:grin:
